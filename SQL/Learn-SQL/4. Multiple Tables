1. Multiple Tables

CREATE TABLE artists (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

2. Primary Key 

SELECT * FROM albums;
SELECT * FROM artists;

remove query and type. 
SELECT * FROM artists 
WHERE id = 3;

SELECT * FROM albums 
WHERE artist_id = 3;


3. Foreign Key

SELECT albums.name, albums.year, artists.name
FROM albums, artists;

4. Cross Join

SELECT * 
FROM albums
JOIN artists ON
albums.artist_id = artists.id;

5. Inner Join 

SELECT * FROM albums
LEFT JOIN artists ON
	albums.artist_id = artists.id;
  

6. Left Outer Join
SELECT
  albums.name AS 'Album',
  albums.year,
  artists.name AS 'Artist'
FROM
  albums
JOIN artists ON
  albums.artist_id = artists.id
WHERE
  albums.year > 1980;
  
  7. Alisases 
  
Learned about relationships between tables in relational databases. 
Also learned how to query data from multiple tables using SQL.

8. Generalisations 

Primary Key is a column that serves a unique identifier for row in the table. 
            Values in this column must be unique and cannot be NULL.
Foreign Key is a column that contains the primary key to another table in the database. 
            It is used to identify a particular row in the referenced table.
            
Joins are used in SQL to combine data from multiple tables.
INNER JOIN will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.
LEFT OUTER JOIN will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, 
                NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.
AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table in the result set using an alias.
