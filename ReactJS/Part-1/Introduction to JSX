1. Why React? 

Welcome to Introduction to React.js, Part I!

React.js is a JavaScript library. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

Here are just a few of the reasons why people choose to program with React:

React is fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.
React is modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. React's modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript's maintainability problems.
React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.
React is flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. People are still figuring out React's potential. There's room to explore.
React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React's quality, the truth is that understanding React will make you more employable.
If you are new to React, then this course is for you! No prior React knowledge is expected.
We will start at the very beginning and move slowly.

If you are new to JavaScript, then consider taking our JavaScript course and then returning to React.

The three Codecademy React courses are not a high-level overview.
They are a deep dive. 
Take your time! By the end, you will be ready to program in React with a real understanding of what you're doing.

2. Hello World 
copy the following code into app.js
var h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
click run when finished. 

3. The Myster solved. 

Take another look at the line of code that you wrote.

Does this code belong in a JavaScript file, an HTML file, or somewhere else?

The answer is...a JavaScript file! Despite what it looks like, your code doesn't actually contain any HTML at all.

The part that looks like HTML, <h1>Hello world</h1>, is something called JSX.

4. What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.

What does "syntax extension" mean?

In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can't read it!

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

Codecademy's servers already have a JSX compiler installed, so you don't have to worry about that for now. Eventually we'll walk through how to set up a JSX compiler on your personal computer.
