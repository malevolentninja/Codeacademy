5. Line Break and Horizontal Rule 

/* Write your content below this line: #begin#

In HTML, the content seperated by line break(s) are in the same paragraph.

---
A horizontal rule defines a thematic break in an HTML page.
(e.g. a shift of topic)  
It's not only a visual separator.

Markdown, An Awesome Tool for a Writer
=======

Write paragraphs separated by a blank line.

You don't need to handle "p-tags" anymore.

Write "Smoothly"
-------

### Strong and Emphasis

No HTML tags. Put stars to **bold** or *italic*.

### Line Break and Horizontal Rule

You need to put two spaces at the end of the line  
for a  
line break.

Use a horizontal rule to shift topic in the article.

-------

**Please make use of Markdown in discussions from now on!!**

7. Code Span and Block

/* Write your content below this line: #begin#

In the exercise, I tried a lot of different way

`I tried: function nickname = (name) {(some codes)}`

 `and: nickname = function(name) {(some codes)}
but it just doesn't let me pass.`

    var first_name = 'Pan';
    var last_name = 'Cake';
    var nickname = function(name) {
    // merge the name

    return first_name + last_name;
    }
    console.log(name);

Is that a bug in Codecademy? (palm face)
