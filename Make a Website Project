Make a Website


1. What are HTML and CSS?
HTML and CSS
Webpage is an individual page from a webiste.


2. Anatomy of an HTML Element
All HTML elements begin with an opening tag. In this case, the opening tag is <h1>. Some require closing tag /, in this case </h1>.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Ollie Bike Sharing</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Building a website</h1>
</body>
</html>


3.Add a Heading
Six heading element: h1(largest) to h6(smallest).
Use the largest heading to indicate the name of the website:
<h1> Ollie Bike Sharing </h1>
Use an h3 heading to create the tagline for Ollie Bike Sharing on the next line:
<h3>Share Your Pedals with the World.</h3>


4.Add a Paragraph
There is a heading and a tagline but now we need a paragraph element. The HTML paragraph element, p, is used to hold one or more sentences, just like paragraphs in an essay or a book.
Below the h3 element, add a paragraph element that contains a description of the company:
<h3>
    Share your Pedals with the World.
  </h3>
     <p> Need a set of wheels while you're in town? Use Ollie to pair your perfect vacation with a stylish, affordable bike rental.</p>


5. Anchor Elements
link users to a different webpage using HTML anchor element. <a href=" "> </a>
create an anchor element to send visitors to a webpage that lists cities where Ollie bike sharing is available between <p> and </p> after the as sentence add "Here is a list of cities where you can find us.":
<p>
     Need a set of wheels while you're in town? Use Ollie to pair your perfect vacation with a stylish, affordable bike rental.
     Here is a <a href="cities.html"> </a> list of cities where you can find us.
  </p>
Next, use an anchor element to link the word "list" to the URL cities.html:
<p> Here is a <a href="cities.html"> list</a>  of cities where you can find us.
  </p>

6. A closer Look
Firstly, any valid URL can be used for the value of the href attribute.

Secondly, the URL must be enclosed with quotation marks.

Finally, text between the <a> and </a> tags can be as few or as many words as you would like.


7. Adding Images
Use the html <img src=" "/> element. urls tend to end with .jpg or png file extenions. src attribute sets the source for an image element. These are self closing = don't need a closing tag.
On the line below the paragraph element, add an image element. Use the following as the image URL
https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/bikes1.jpg:
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/bikes1.jpg" />

Change the photo that the image element displays by setting the value of src to a different photo's URL.
https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/bikes2.jpg:
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/bikes2.jpg"/>



8. Add a Video
A Video is much cooler to have than a simple photo!
The HTML video element can add video to a webpage.
The video element uses a number of attributes.
Width and height = Set the size of the screen that displays the video.
controls = Adds play, pause and volume control.
source src = Sets the URL of the video to play.
type = Specifies different video formats.

Delete the image element so we can use that space on the webpage for a video.
<video width =" " height = " "  controls>
    <source src=" " type=" ">
</video>
below the paragraph element, create a video element. Use the code above as a guide.
The video will need:
-width and height attributes
- a controls attribute
- a source src set to:https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/ollie.mp4. All attribute values need to be in quotes except controls:
  <video width="320" height="240" controls>
        <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/ollie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>


9. Create an unordered List
Unordered list are refered to as list items and each item is bulleted.
ul tags = create the unordered list.
li tags = contain each list item.
Can be used to organise navigation menu e.g. navbar.
create some new lines. In index.html, press enter to create several new lines between <body> and <h1>.
First, we will create an h2 element to serve as the heading for the navbar. The text can read "Ollie":
<h2> Ollie </h2>
Below the navbar h2, create an unordered list element. The list items will be different pages a site user can visit:
<ul>
  <li>sign up</li>
  <li>search bikes</li>
  <li>reserve a bike</li>
  <li>about us</li>
</ul>


10. Parent and Child Elements
Enclosing element is the parent element and the enclosed elements are known as children.
 -> The ul element = parent of each li.
 -> The li elements = children of the ul.
 ->Code indentation signifies the relationship between parent and child elements.


11.Add a Div
Div elements divide your page by enclosing other elements. These enclosed groups of elements can then be organized, moved and styled independently from one another.
Use divs to divide our page into three separate parts.
First enclose all the elements between <body> </body> tags in a div element:
<div class="container">
    ...
</div>
All the HTML elements you added in previous exercises should be inside the opening <div class="container">:

the navbar h2
the navbar ul
the company heading h1
the tagline h3
the paragraph
the video
The results:
<div class="container">
    <body>
        <h1>Ollie Bike Sharing</h1>
        <h2> Ollie </h2>
        <h3>
    Share your Pedals with the World.
  </h3>
             <p>
               Need a set of wheels while you're in town? Use Ollie to pair your perfect vacation with a stylish, affordable bike rental. Here is a <a href="cities.html"> list</a>  of cities where you can find us.
               </p>
          <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/ollie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
    </body>
</div>
Next, we will enclose the navbar h2 and ul in another div and give it a class attribute of "nav":
<div class="nav">
  <h2>
    Ollie
  </h2>

  <ul>

    <li>sign up</li>
    <li>search bikes</li>
    <li>reserve a bike</li>
    <li>about us</li>
  </ul>
</div>


12. Metadata: the Brains
These communicate vital information to the web browser but are not visible on the page to a visitor.
<!DOCTYPE html>: Tells the web browser to expect an HTML document.

<html>...</html>: The root of the HTML document and parent of all other HTML elements on the webpage.

<head>...</head>: Enclose other metadata about the site, such as its title.

<title>...</title>: Contains the site's title, which is one way users can find your site through a search engine, like Google.

<meta charset="utf-8"/>: Tells the web browser which character set to use. In this case, the character set is "utf-8".


13. HTML Review


Languages
- HTML = Hypertext Markup
- CSS  = Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style HTML

HTML elements:
- h1 to h6 = text headings:
<h1>Heading</h1>
- p = non-heading text e.e.g bodies of articles or comapny descriptions:
<p>Description of company here.</p>
- a = anchor used to add links to webpages and typically have href attribute:
<a href="http://codecademy.com">Click here</a> to learn how to make a website!
- img = add an image to webpage , they are self closing:
<img src="https://images.com/favorite.png">
- video = add videos to webpage and uses multiple attributes and a nested source element:
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://movies.io/great-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
- unordered list = create lists on a webpage:
<ul>
  <li>list item</li>
  <li>another item</li>
  <li>yet another</li>
</ul>
- div = organise HTML elements into different groups , can be given class attributes:
<div class="main">
  <h2>Subheading!</h2>
</div>
- metadata tags = provide metadata about a webpage.

WEB concepts
parent/child elements = describe HTML elements that enclose or are enclosed by other elements.
